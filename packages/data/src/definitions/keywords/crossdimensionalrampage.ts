        "You don’t need to know the whole history of Marvel comics to judge who counts as a Hulk – just rely on whether the card says Hulk in its name or not. There are only a few, very specific exceptions we have to make to stay true to the characters: “Nul, Breaker of Worlds” from Fear Itself and “Maestro” (core set) count as Hulks for this."

        "Some Heroes can transform into Hulks, like Bruce Banner and Amadeus Cho. A puny “Bruce Banner” card doesn’t say “Hulk” on it, so it can’t stop a Hulk Rampage. But revealing the transformed Bruce Banner card named “Savage Hulk Unleashed” works."
